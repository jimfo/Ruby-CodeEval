# Title : Testing from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case with two strings
# separated by a pipeline '|'. The first string is the one the developers provided to you for testing,
# and the second one is from design.Write a program that counts the number of bugs and prioritizes them
# for fixing using the following statuses:
#   'Low' - 2 or fewer bugs;
#   'Medium' - 4 or fewer bugs;
#   'High' - 6 or fewer bugs;
#   'Critical' - more than 6 bugs;
#   'Done' - all is done;

      if test[i] != control[i]
        bugCount += 1
