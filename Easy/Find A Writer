# Title : Find A Writer from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description :  You have a set of rows with names of famous writers encoded inside.
# Each row is divided into 2 parts by pipe char (|). The first part has a writer's name.
# The second part is a "key" to generate a name. Your goal is to go through each number
# in the key (numbers are separated by space) left-to-right. Each number represents a position
# in the 1st part of a row. This way you collect a writer's name which you have to output.

File.open("data").each_line do |line|
  if !line.empty?

    line.strip!
    line = line.split("|")
    alphaArr = line[0].split("")
    numArr = line[1].split(" ").map { |x| x.to_i }
    writer = ""

    for i in 0...numArr.length
      writer << alphaArr[numArr[i]-1]
    end
    print writer
    puts
  end
