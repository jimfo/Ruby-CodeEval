# Title : Data Recovery from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : Each line is a test case which consists of a set of words and a sequence of numbers
# separated by a semicolon. The words within a set and the numbers within a sequence are separated
# by a single space. Print out a reconstructed sentence for each test case, one per line.
