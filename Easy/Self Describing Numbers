# Title : Self Describing Numbers from File from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : A number is a self-describing number when (assuming digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1),
# the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number
# If the number is a self-describing number, print out 1. If not, print out 0.

File.open("data").each_line do |line|
  if !line.empty?
    line.strip!
    line = line.chomp.split("").map { |x| x.to_i }
    happy = true

    for i in 0...line.length
      z = line[i]
      x = line.count(i)

      if z != x
        happy = false
        break
      end
    end

      puts 1
    else
      puts 0
