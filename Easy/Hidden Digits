# Title : Hidden Digits from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : In this challenge you're given a random string containing hidden and visible digits.
# The digits are hidden behind lower case latin letters as follows: 0 is behind 'a', 1 is behind ' b '
# etc., 9 is behind 'j'. Any other symbol in the string means nothing and has to be ignored.

File.open("data").each_line do |line|
  if !line.empty?
    digits = { "a" => 0, "b" => 1, "c" => 2, "d" => 3, "e" => 4,
               "f" => 5, "g" => 6, "h" => 7, "i" => 8, "j" => 9}

    line = line.split("")
    found = false
    for i in 0...line.length
      if digits.has_key?(line[i])
        print digits[line[i]]
        found = true
      elsif line[i].ord >= 48 && line[i].ord <= 57
        print line[i]
        found = true
      end
    end
    if !found
      print "NONE"
    end
    puts

  end
end
