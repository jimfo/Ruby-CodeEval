# Description :  You have coordinates of 2 points and need to find the distance between them.

File.open("data").each_line do |line|
  if !line.empty?
    line.strip!

    x1, y1, x2, y2 = line.scan(/-*[0-9]+/).map { |n| n.to_i }

    distance = Math.sqrt(((x1-x2)**2) + ((y1-y2)**2))
    puts Integer(distance)
    
  end
