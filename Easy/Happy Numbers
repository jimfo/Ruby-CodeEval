# Title : Happy Numbers from CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer,
# replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number
# equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers
# for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
